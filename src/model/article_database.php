Armenia, Artashat. Moses of Khorene recounts in his History of Armenia how King Tiridates
IV of Armenia (or Trdat) hunted down and persecuted the Christians in the fourth century.
Gregory (Krikor) Loussavoritch, future Gregory the Illuminator, was thrown into oblivion
(\"Virap\") in a pit. He miraculously survived for thirteen years (by the way, this 
monastery is nicknamed Prison of Saint Gregory; Khor Virap means \"deep well\"). 
When the king, after having martyred Gayané, Hripsimé and their companions fell ill, 
Grégoire Loussavoritch appeared to be the only one capable of treating him. He heals the 
king and converts him to Christianity. Armenia then becomes the first Christian country.
Catholicos Nerses III Chinanar says the builder had a church built above the pit in the
7th century.";

Mithras. After Armenia's conversion to Christianity in the early 4th century, it became the
royal summer residence of Khosrovidukht, sister of Tiridates III of Armenia. According to 
some historians, it is not a temple but a tomb and that is why it survived the general 
destruction of ancient pagan buildings. During the 1679 earthquake in Armenia, the temple 
collapsed. The renewed interest in the 19th century led to the organization of excavations
